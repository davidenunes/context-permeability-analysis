Data Organisation
=================
This file describes the data organisation structure for the _Context Permeability Project_. 
The data itself will be hosted somewhere else. For each different experiment I will maintain 
a different directory. This document will describe each experiment briefly and . Each experiment will have a README

```

    ├── data
    │   ├── README.html
    │   └── README.md
    └── experiments
        └── ModelValidation.Rmd
